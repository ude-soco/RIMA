Getting away from the traditional top-down approaches, the learner is more and more in control of selecting learning resources or choosing the right learning techniques. On the one hand, by following the idea of a learner-centric Personal Learning Environment it is now possible to freely design an own learning environment with all required tools to improve the learning process. On the other hand, the ubiquitous usage of mobile devices such as smart phones or tablet computers creates the basis for new modern learning scenarios. While different applications for the devices already allow an individual aggregation of tools they are still highly separated and cannot interact beyond the borders of one application. In this paper, we present a new approach realizing application ecologies on mobile devices which allow integrating services and functionalities of one application into another one. This may happen ad-hoc without involvement of application developers resulting in high extensibility. Furthermore, it allows the user to adjust the app system according to his needs and creates the impression of one seamless mobile PLE consisting of an adjustable set of applications.", "year": 2015, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "99371136f37ef54cf39d0abeae20fff86b16c517", "authors": "U.

The learner is put into focus and offered general conditions for self-organized learning. At the same time mobile technology is becoming omnipresent and an essential part of today's learning. Although many (web) frameworks have been developed allowing the user to create his own PLE the mobile learner is not really reached. Although the mobile application architecture supports the PLE concept in general in the sense of aggregating different independent tools, the missing interrelations cause losses of contexts while switching between them. At the same time, necessary additional information cannot be presented in context as an enhancement creating added value. This paper introduces a concept for symbiotic interrelation and seamless integration of mobile applications as mobile personalizable learning environments where the user is in control of shap- ing his mobile learning environment seamlessly. Services and features of applications can be used inside one another and even across the borders of a single device. Thereby, contexts of one appli- cation can be used in further services and additional information can be visualized directly embed- ded where it is needed. Moreover, the seamless design comes with additional benefits such as advanced navigation and improves the learning process in its entirety.", "year": 2015, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "fcb1205f3306fe3267bebea0e0294ee0a940a321", "authors": "U.

MOOCs provide more educational opportunities to a massive number of learners to attend free online courses around the globe. Discussions around MOOCs have been focusing on the potential, social, institutional, technological, relevance, and marketing issues and less on the quality design of MOOC environments. Several studies have reported a high drop-out rate in average of 95% of course participants and other pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback. Thus, the quality of MOOCs design is worth additional investigation. Although several studies identified a large set of criteria to the successful design of TEL systems in general, not all of them can be used in the MOOC context, due to some unique features of MOOCs. This study is a first step towards identifying specific criteria that need to be considered when designing and implementing MOOCs. The results of this empirical study are based on a large survey targeting learners as well as professors, both with MOOC experience. As a result, we identified and rated 74 indicators classified into our two main dimensions of pedagogical and technological criteria distributed over six categories. From these, the learning analytics and assessment categories were found to be the key features for effective MOOCs.", "year": 2014, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "a64c56344c376e1eb423eb8a051037e9b0358d20", "authors": "U.

The case study objective was to observe in which ways the teaching staff would use the learning analytics module while performing other teaching activities within the course room on the learning platform. We collected raw data from three different sources to examine the hypothesis of the case study in a quasi-experimental setting. The analyzed results showed that over the course of the study, in 40 courses the teaching staff used the learning analytics module at least on one occasion; in 25 courses the teaching stuff used the learning analytics module more than five times; and in 36 courses, the teaching staff has used the learning analytics module on multiple occasions within the same session while conducting teaching activities on the learning platform. As part of the data collection strategy for the case study, we conducted a two-part anonymous survey to collect qualitative feedback about the features and the user interface of the analytics prototype. The results of the survey revealed that the teaching staff used the analytics prototype mainly to observe the learning resources in their respective courses and be aware about the student behavior in their courses on the learning platform. Overall, we concluded that Learning Analytics should be an integral part of the provisioned e-learning services in higher educational institutions; the place for delivering Learning Analytics is the virtual course rooms on the learning platform; and that the teaching staff (if provided) would use it on regular basis in short while doing their day-to-day teaching activities on the learning platform.", "year": 2018, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "55ea8d6d720f24bb8926ee5a92b044f920c92c82", "authors": "U.

This recent shift in education has had its effects on the field of assessment and feedback as well. The traditional methods of assessment are being replaced by new methods from the field of open assessment. One such assessment method for open learning environments is peer assessment. Peer assessment is a crowd sourcing technique which lessens the teacher workload and gives students a voice in the assessment process. Despite being the leading assessment method in open learning environments, the tools available for peer assessment are lagging far behind. Most peer assessment tools are context and domain specific which hinders their uniform adoption across different fields of study.

One of the main goals of the integration of traditional teaching methods with technology enhancements is the improvement of teaching and learning quality in large university courses with many students. But does utilizing a VLE automatically improve teaching and learning? In our experience, many teachers just upload existing files, like lecture slides, handouts and exercises, when starting to use a VLE. Thereby availability of learning resources is improved. For improving teaching and learning it could be helpful to create more motivating, challenging, and engaging learning materials and e.g., collaborative scenarios to improve learning among large groups of students. Teachers could e.g., use audio and video recordings of their lectures or provide interactive, demonstrative multimedia examples and quizzes. If they put effort in the design of such online learning activities, they need tools that help them observe the consequences of their actions and evaluate their teaching interventions. They need to have appropriate access to data to assess changing behaviors and performances of their students to estimate the level of improvement that has been achieved in the learning environment. With the establishment of TEL, a new research field, called Learning Analytics, is emerging (Elias, 2011). This research field borrows and synthesizes techniques from different related fields, such as Educational Data Mining (EDM), Academic Analytics, Social Network Analysis or Business Intelligence (BI), to harness them for converting educational data into useful information and thereon to motivate actions, like self-reflecting ones previous teaching or learning activities, to foster improved teaching and learning. The main goal of BI is to turn enterprise data into useful information for management decision support. However, Learning Analytics, Academic Analytics, as well as EDM more specifically focus on tools and methods for exploring data coming from educational contexts. While Academic Analytics take a university-wide perspective, including also e.g., organizational and financial issues (Campbell & Oblinger, 2007), Learning Analytics as well as EDM focus specifically on data about teaching and learning. Siemens (2010) defines Learning Analytics as \"the use of intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to discover information and social connections, and to predict and advise on learning.\" It can support teachers and students to take action based on the evaluation of educational data. However, the technology to deliver this potential is still very young and research on understanding the pedagogical usefulness of Learning Analytics is still in its infancy (Johnson et al., 2011b; Johnson et al., 2012). It is a current goal at RWTH Aachen University to enhance its VLE--the learning and teaching portal L2P (Gebhardt et al., 2007)--with user-friendly tools for Learning Analytics, in order to equip their teachers and tutors with means to evaluate the effectiveness of TEL within their instructional design and courses offered. These teachers still face difficulties, deterring them from integrating cyclical reflective research activities, comparable to Action Research, into everyday practice. Action Research is characterized by a continuing effort to closely interlink, relate and confront action and reflection, to reflect upon one's conscious and unconscious doings in order to develop one's actions, and to act reflectively in order to develop one's knowledge.\" (Altrichter et al., 2005, p. 6). A pre-eminent barrier is the additional workload, originating from tasks of collecting, integrating, and analyzing raw data from log files of their VLE (Altenbernd-Giani et al., 2009). To tackle these issues, we have developed the \"exploratory Learning Analytics Toolkit\" (eLAT). \u2026", "year": 2012, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "3f204f1eaef37645f1d84ab784d813370704bca7", "authors": "U.

MOOCs have unique features that make them an effective Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL) approach. Institutions are offering a growing variety of MOOCs. Nevertheless, there are several crucial challenges that should be considered in the development of MOOCs, e.g., the drop-out rate of over 95% of course participants. One of the potential reasons for that is the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. This diversity is not only related to the cultural and demographic profile, but also considers the diverse motives and perspectives when enrolled in MOOCs. This paper aims to cluster and analyze the different objectives of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors. Our main finding was a set of eight clusters, i.e., blended learning, flexibility, high quality content, instructional design and learning methodologies, lifelong learning, network learning, openness, and student-centered learning.

MOOCs have unique features that support a movement toward a vision of lifelong and on-demand learning for those who are working full time or have taken a break from formal education. Despite their popularity and the large scale participation, a variety of concerns and criticism in the use of MOOCs have been raised. The original concept of MOOCs that aims at breaking down obstacles to education for anyone, anywhere and at any time is far away from the reality. In fact, most MOOC implementations so far still follow a top-down, controlled, teacher-centered, and centralized learning model. Endeavors to implement bottom-up, student-centered, truly open, decentralized, and distributed forms of MOOCs are exceptions rather than the rule. Moreover, the lack of human interaction is the major limitation of the existing MOOCs. Other limitations of MOOCs include pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback, the lack of interactivity around the video content, as well as the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. Furthermore, a major problem with MOOCs is the ignorance of the importance and benefits of face-toface communication. These limitations raise some serious concerns on what role MOOCs should play, or how they should fit into the higher education landscape as an alternative model of teaching and learning and a substantial supplement. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to shine new light to address these limitations. The new design paradigm of blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) that aim at bringing in-class (i.e. face-to-face) interactions and online learning components together as a blended environment can resolve some of the hurdles facing standalone MOOCs. In fact, the bMOOCs model has the potential to foster student-centered learning, provide effective assessment and feedback, support the interactive design of the video lectures, consider the different patterns of participants in the MOOC, as well as bring the benefits of face-toface interactions into the MOOC environment. This dissertation followed the case study research methodology and the user-centered design approach, in order to design, implement, and evaluate the LP-bMOOC platform. The main contributions are: a theoretical framework that compile and analyze the accumulated literature that has been conducted on Video-Based Learning and MOOCs between 2008 and 2015, a cluster of different patterns of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors, a design dimension and criteria catalogue for effective bMOOC environments, the conceptualization and implementation of the LP-bMOOC platform, an evaluation procedure for usability and effectiveness of bMOOCs, and opportunities for future work in the area of bMOOCs.", "year": 2015, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "b3c0cefb6d2c66556bd875a8ed82c452cf8b338f", "authors": "U.

The \u201cSnowflake\u201d model is based on the idea of integrating raw resources and behaviours with the elements of gamification to form a micro gamified experience, which combines many items that lead to gamified assignments on the macro level. The most obvious finding to emerge from the design is that micro-level analysis has a positive impact on gamified assignment, which begins with the identification of raw objects such as quizzes, lessons, learning objects, and tools.

Several studies have reported a high drop-out rate in average of 95% of course participants and other pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback. Thus, the quality of MOOCs design is worth additional investigation. Although several studies identified a large set of criteria to the successful design of TEL systems in general, not all of them can be used in the MOOC context, due to some unique features of MOOCs. This study is a first step towards identifying specific criteria that need to be considered when designing and implementing MOOCs. The results of this empirical study are based on a large survey targeting learners as well as professors, both with MOOC experience. As a result, we identified and rated 74 indicators classified into our two main dimensions of pedagogical and technological criteria distributed over six categories.

The authors grouped these communities of practice in three categories: education, fields and professions, and citizenship. The meaning of data literacy varies depending on who uses it, and its concept is often conveyed in terms other than data literacy. This paper addresses the problematization of data literacy as a term by examining academic literature around it. To this end, a desk study was carried out to gather sources where the term is used.

MOOCs are quite different from classical distance learning settings in terms of their open\u2010access features, such as open licensing of course content, and their use of specific infrastructures for communications and learning tools. Studies over the past 2 years (2018, 2019) have examined the multitude of experimental business models for MOOCs. However, MOOCs have also experimented with a wide variety of course content, teaching and learning methods, and assessment strategies. Very few articles have systematically examined these significant changes. To address this gap, we conducted an extensive, qualitative meta\u2010analyses of over 200 peer\u2010reviewed articles describing research on MOOCs. This analysis is organized around the following questions: (a) How can we classify existing MOOCs in terms of their support for learners and learning? (b) Which learners are benefiting from MOOCs, and to what degree have MOOCs explored approaches to student\u2010centered learning? (c) To what degree are MOOCs meeting the needs of different learner audiences? (d) How can MOOC providers and participants communicate effectively to support student learning and engagement? (e) How can student activities be monitored to ensure that assessments of learning are performed effectively?

MOOCs have unique features that support a movement toward a vision of lifelong and on-demand learning for those who are working full time or have taken a break from formal education. Despite their popularity and the large scale participation, a variety of concerns and criticism in the use of MOOCs have been raised. The original concept of MOOCs that aims at breaking down obstacles to education for anyone, anywhere and at any time is far away from the reality. In fact, most MOOC implementations so far still follow a top-down, controlled, teacher-centered, and centralized learning model. Endeavors to implement bottom-up, student-centered, truly open, decentralized, and distributed forms of MOOCs are exceptions rather than the rule. Moreover, the lack of human interaction is the major limitation of the existing MOOCs. Other limitations of MOOCs include pedagogical problems concerning assessment and feedback, the lack of interactivity around the video content, as well as the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants. Furthermore, a major problem with MOOCs is the ignorance of the importance and benefits of face-toface communication. These limitations raise some serious concerns on what role MOOCs should play, or how they should fit into the higher education landscape as an alternative model of teaching and learning and a substantial supplement. Therefore, the aim of this dissertation is to shine new light to address these limitations. The new design paradigm of blended MOOCs (bMOOCs) that aim at bringing in-class (i.e. face-to-face) interactions and online learning components together as a blended environment can resolve some of the hurdles facing standalone MOOCs. In fact, the bMOOCs model has the potential to foster student-centered learning, provide effective assessment and feedback, support the interactive design of the video lectures, consider the different patterns of participants in the MOOC, as well as bring the benefits of face-toface interactions into the MOOC environment. This dissertation followed the case study research methodology and the user-centered design approach, in order to design, implement, and evaluate the LP-bMOOC platform. The main contributions are: a theoretical framework that compile and analyze the accumulated literature that has been conducted on Video-Based Learning and MOOCs between 2008 and 2015, a cluster of different patterns of MOOC stakeholders to build a deeper and better understanding of their behaviors, a design dimension and criteria catalogue for effective bMOOC environments, the conceptualization and implementation of the LP-bMOOC platform, an evaluation procedure for usability and effectiveness of bMOOCs, and opportunities for future work in the area of bMOOCs.", "year": 2015, "updated_on": "2022", "created_on": "2022"}, {"id": 1, "paper_id": "2d1b771ff2ac17a447f168693ec6e4fed18dbbf8", "authors": "E.
